You are playing as Robert who is a very successfull photographer from Taiwan. Currently he is visiting
Iceland in the wintertime, chasing aurora.
It is a beautiful evening and you have catched some great pictures of the northern lights.
You are located in the front of a small hotel in North of Iceland. You have stayed there many times before
and it almost feels like a second home. When you get up to the entrance, you get a feeling that something has
changed from what it used to be.
What do you do? Use wasd keys to move.
