          in the room are covered with drapes. The room has a big bed with

          bed. At the end of the bed there is a cage, like a cage for a 
          large dog, but there is no dog, just some collars and something 
          that looks like black bones, but you can not see clear in the 
          dark. There is also a big old closet there.
